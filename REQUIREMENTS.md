# ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech MCP Integration

## Project Overview
A Cursor MCP (Machine Control Protocol) application that converts text output into spoken words using the ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API. The system consists of three main components: a backend service, a web interface, and an MCP binary for Cursor integration.

## Core Components

### 1. Backend Service
- ✅ Python-based FastAPI application
- ⏳ MCP SDK integration (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.6.0 via Python bindings)
- ✅ Environment configuration management (python-dotenv)
- ✅ Configuration file handling for persistent settings (PyYAML)
- ⏳ API endpoint for Text-to-Speech conversion
- ⏳ Event routing between components using asyncio
- ⏳ WebSocket support for real-time communication

### 2. Web Interface
- ⏳ Standalone web UI (served via FastAPI)
- 🎯 Text-to-Speech testing functionality
- 🎯 Voice selection and preview capabilities
- 🎯 Real-time display of TTS responses
- ⏳ WebSocket connection for live updates
- ⏳ Event listener for MCP commands

### 3. MCP Binary
- ✅ Standalone Python executable
- ⏳ MCP command integration for Cursor
- ⏳ Communication with backend service via HTTP/WebSocket
- 🎯 Text-to-Speech command handling
- ⏳ Async operation support

## System Architecture
- ⏳ FastAPI backend handles routing and WebSocket connections
- ⏳ Web UI runs as static assets served by FastAPI
- ⏳ MCP Binary acts as bridge between Cursor and backend
- ⏳ Event-driven communication using asyncio and WebSockets
- ⏳ Asynchronous TTS processing with background tasks

## Technical Requirements
- ✅ Python 3.11+ runtime environment
- ✅ FastAPI for backend services
- ⏳ ElevenLabs API key configuration
- 🎯 Browser compatibility for Web UI
- ⏳ Cursor MCP protocol support
- ✅ Local configuration persistence using YAML
- ✅ Poetry for dependency management
